# Simple System Logger (SiSyL) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zack-baker/Simple-System-Logger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zack-baker/Simple-System-Logger)
SiSyL is a simple way to log anything you want. It uses a database to log entries, and has an easy-to-use command line interface to manage these logs.

Currently very much a WIP!
